# Deployment Matrix

Deploying Gins-Blog requires an active Cloudflare account and Wrangler CLI configured on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- `Node.js >= 24.0.0`
- `npm` or `pnpm`
- Cloudflare Wrangler (`npm i -g wrangler`)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must run `wrangler login` and authenticate your terminal against your Cloudflare organization before proceeding.

## Step 1: Resource Provisioning

The project relies on specific Cloudflare bindings. You must create these resources prior to pushing code.

```bash
# 1. Create the serverless database
wrangler d1 create gins-db

# 2. Create the Key-Value store for session caching
wrangler kv:namespace create SESSION

# 3. Create the Vectorize index for AI search
wrangler vectorize create gins-vectors --dimensions=384 --metric=cosine
```

Update your `wrangler.jsonc` file with the IDs generated by the commands above.

## Step 2: Database Migration

Before the application can read/write data, the schema must be pushed to D1.

```bash
# Push schema locally for development
npm run db:push

# Push schema to production D1
wrangler d1 execute gins-db --file=./db/migrations/0000_schema.sql --remote
```

## Step 3: Ignition

Once the database is primed and the bindings are set, you can deploy the application globally.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Watch as the application distributes itself across the edge network in seconds. The terminal will output your `.workers.dev` domain, which you can later map to a custom domain in your Cloudflare Dash.
